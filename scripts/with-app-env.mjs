/**
 * Run a command with `.grok/app-env.json` merged into its environment.
 *
 * `dev`, `build` and `preview` all route through this wrapper, so the dev
 * server, the built bundle and the preview server can never disagree about
 * `VITE_AUTH_ENABLED` — a divergence that only shows up as a built-output
 * mismatch long after the fact. Anything that starts Vite directly bypasses it.
 *
 * Only `VITE_`-prefixed keys are honored: the file is a build flag carrier, not
 * a secret store, and only `VITE_` vars reach the browser anyway. A real
 * `process.env` entry always wins, so an explicit override still works.
 *
 * That precedence also means the file governs this workspace only. A deployed
 * build runs with the provider's project env, where the deployer sets
 * `VITE_AUTH_ENABLED` itself (today unconditionally `"true"`), so the deployed
 * flag is the platform's, not this file's.
 *
 * Vite picks the values up because `loadEnv` prefix-matches entries already in
 * `process.env`, which is why the merge has to happen before Vite starts.
